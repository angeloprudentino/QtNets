      \brief The GrueSensorReading class holds readings from the Grue sensor.

      The Grue Sensor informs you of your chance of being eaten by a Grue.

      Grues love the dark so as long as your surroundings are relatively light
      you are safe. However the more time you spend in the dark, the higher
      your chances are of being eaten by a Grue.

  <span class="comment">/*
      \property GrueSensorReading::chanceOfBeingEaten
      \brief holds your chance of being eaten.

      The value is the probability (from 0 to 100) that a Grue will eat you.
      A probability of 100 means you are currently being eaten. The darker
      it is, the more likely you are to be eaten by a Grue. The longer you
      stay in a dark area, the more likely you are to be eaten by a Grue.
      If you are in a lit room, the probability will be 0 as Grues fear light.
