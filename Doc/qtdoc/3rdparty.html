<!-- $$$3rdparty.html-description -->
<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide certain features. Unlike the code described in the <a href="licenses.html">Other Licenses Used in Qt</a> document, these libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules. For an overview of Qt licensing and a list of all third-party code in Qt, see <a href="licensing.html">Qt Licensing</a>.</p>
<p>Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the LGPL or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they are using.</p>
<p>Run <code>configure -help</code> to see any options that may be available for controlling the use of these libraries.</p>
<p>Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can normally be found by reviewing the change history of the corresponding files in the public Qt repository.</p>

                      ----------------------------

                              2000-Jul-04

            Copyright (C) 2000 by Catharon Productions, Inc.

  Introduction
  ============

    This  license  applies to  source  files  distributed by  Catharon
    Productions,  Inc.  in  several  archive packages.   This  license
    applies  to all files  found in  such packages  which do  not fall
    under their own explicit license.

    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

      o We  don't promise that  this software works.  However,  we are
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        Catharon Code. (`credits')

    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We disclaim  all warranties  covering the packages  distributed by
    Catharon  Productions, Inc.  and  assume no  liability related  to
    their use.

  Legal Terms
  ===========

  0. Definitions
  --------------

    Throughout this license,  the terms `Catharon Package', `package',
    and  `Catharon  Code'  refer   to  the  set  of  files  originally
    distributed by Catharon Productions, Inc.

    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program  is referred  to  as `a  program  using  one of  the
    Catharon Packages'.

    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    Catharon  Package(s),  including  all  source code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.

    The  Catharon   Packages  are  copyright  (C)   2000  by  Catharon
    Productions, Inc.  All rights reserved except as specified below.

  1. No Warranty
  --------------

    THE CATHARON PACKAGES ARE PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO
    USE THE CATHARON PACKAGE.

  2. Redistribution
  -----------------

    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  Catharon Packages (in both source  and object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:

      o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
        (`license.txt') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
        to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
        accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
        unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
        source files.

      o Redistribution  in binary form must provide  a disclaimer that
        states  that the  software is  based in  part on  the  work of
        Catharon Productions, Inc. in the distribution documentation.

    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the Catharon Packages, not just  the unmodified files.  If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.

  3. Advertising
  --------------

    Neither Catharon Productions, Inc.  and contributors nor you shall
    use  the  name  of  the  other  for  commercial,  advertising,  or
    promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.

    We suggest, but do not  require, that you use the following phrase
    to refer to this software in your documentation: 'this software is
    based in part on the Catharon Typography Project'.

    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.  However,  as  the Catharon  Packages are  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  Catharon
    Packages,  you indicate  that you  understand and  accept  all the
    terms of this license.

  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
  arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability

  and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
  Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
  warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
  consistent with this License. However, in accepting such

  made,   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
  the Work,   where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
  their   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
  Contribution(s)   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
  submitted. If You   institute patent litigation against any entity
  (including a   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
  that the Work   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
  constitutes direct   or contributory patent infringement, then any
  patent licenses   granted to You under this License for that Work
  shall terminate   as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and may provide additional or different license terms and
    conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
    otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
  otherwise,   any Contribution intentionally submitted for
  inclusion in the Work   by You to the Licensor shall be under the
  terms and conditions of   this License, without any additional
  terms or conditions.   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
  shall supersede or modify   the terms of any separate license
  agreement you may have executed   with Licensor regarding such
  Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
  trade   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
  Licensor,   except as required for reasonable and customary use in
  describing the   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
  the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
  conditions   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
  FITNESS FOR A   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
  determining the   appropriateness of using or redistributing the
  Work and assume any   risks associated with Your exercise of
  permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special,   incidental, or consequential damages of any character
  arising as a   result of this License or out of the use or
  inability to use the   Work (including but not limited to damages
  for loss of goodwill,   work stoppage, computer failure or
  malfunction, or any and all   other commercial damages or losses),
  even if such Contributor   has been advised of the possibility of
  such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
  redistributing   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
  choose to offer,   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
  warranty, indemnity,   or other liability obligations and/or
  rights consistent with this   License. However, in accepting such
  obligations, You may act only   on Your own behalf and on Your
  sole responsibility, not on behalf   of any other Contributor, and
  only if You agree to indemnify,   defend, and hold each
  Contributor harmless for any liability   incurred by, or claims
  asserted against, such Contributor by reason   of your accepting
  any such warranty or additional liability.

<p><i>The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Avoid privacy-damaging &quot;supercookies&quot; being set for high-level domain name suffixes</i></li>
<li><i>Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface</i></li>
<li><i>Accurately sort history entries by site</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such &quot;supercookies&quot; mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkcookiejar.html">QNetworkCookieJar</a> class).</p>

IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web browsers such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream applications.</i> -- quoted from <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2</a>.</p>

<p>The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both* licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.</p>
<p>To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License, Version 2.0</p>
<p>However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the GPL.</p>
<p>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added features.</p>
<p>Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for more information.</p>
